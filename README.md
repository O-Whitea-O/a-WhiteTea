ðŸ‘‹  Hi, Iâ€™m @a-WhiteTea. I am still learning Programming. I stared learning Java in 2018 and also learned C# in the same year.
    Now (2021), after not looking at a line of code for one year, I'm starting programming again. I am also new to GitHub.
    
About Me:
    My name is Kevin and I am from Germany.
    I am currently doing an apprenticeship as a IT specialist in the field application development.
    (Sorry if my english is not correct)
